            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>My life's journey is to do meaningful work that positively 
                impacts others while always being kind and compassionate. I will be 
                a hardworking, supportive, and reliable person who invests in my 
                family and friends, and I hope they will remember me as successful, 
                kind, and caring. My most important contribution will be helping 
                others and prioritizing strong relationships while striving to 
                always keep organized and calm.</p>
